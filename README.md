This portfolio was developed as a project for my LIS 636 class. It showcases my skills in programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, along with web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've used version control with Git and GitHub to manage this project. Feel free to explore and learn more about my abilities and experiences in the realm of web development and programming.
